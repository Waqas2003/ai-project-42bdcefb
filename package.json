This codebase uses React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS to create a beautiful and responsive travel agency website. The website features a hero section, features section, and footer section. The hero section has a background image, title, and call-to-action button. The features section displays three cards with images, titles, and descriptions. The footer section has a copyright notice and social media links.

You can run the website by executing `npm run dev` in the terminal, and it will be available at `http://localhost:3000`. You can also build the website for production by running `npm run build`, and it will be available in the `build` folder.

Please note that you need to install the dependencies by running `npm install` before running the website.
